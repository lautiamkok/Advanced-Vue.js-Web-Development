For more information about vite-ssr, visit [https://github.com/frandiox/vite-ssr](https://github.com/frandiox/vite-ssr).

You will get the following warning when running your app with vite-ssr:

> vite-ssr doesn't appear to be written in CJS, but also doesn't appear to be a valid ES module (i.e. it doesn't have "type": "module" or an .mjs extension for the entry point). Please contact the package author to fix.

You can safely ignore that warning. Read more about this warning at [https://github.com/frandiox/vite-ssr/issues/159](https://github.com/frandiox/vite-ssr/issues/159).
